# Python Practice

This repository has the aim to keep the python codes to show how I am learning and how I usually solve problems. I'm still not "fluent" in Python, but I practive everyday to improve my habilities.

I am also learning NUMPY library and following the CS50's course "Introduction To AI with Python" 

## Observations!!:

I am not focusing in complete the challends fast or faster than most of the coders. My goal here is to improve my Python habilities and 
enhance my knowledge in this programming language in a pratical way.
